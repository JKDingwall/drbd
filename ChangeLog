9.2.0 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * merged changes from the drbd-9.1 branch, including
  - fix a race that could lead to an unexpected loss of connection
    related to internal concurrency; it manifested itself as
    "BAD! BarrierAck #X received with n_writes=..." in the logs
  - fix a race that could lead to an unexpected loss of connection
    if a node in the quorate partition promotes (too) quickly
  - follow upstream and compat code for up to Linux 5.19

9.2.0-rc.8 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix the RDMA transport to work on more recent kernels (like RHEL9)
 * improve transmit timeout handling of the RDMA transport
 * register DRBD has pernet device for namespace management
 * merged fixes from the drbd-9.1 branch, including
  - request handling (9.1.11)
  - fix quorum when fresh nodes join a quorate but incomplete partition
  - minor state handling fixes/improvements

9.2.0-rc.7 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * support for network namespaces
 * multiple fixes to the merge-discards-during-resync functionality
 * fix reference counting in AL with drbd-8.4 peers
 * stricter limit for the set of characters allowed in resource names
 * merge changes from the drbd 9.1.9 release

9.2.0-rc.6 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fixes to the new way of coordinating resync and application IO
 * merge discard requests during resync on a resync target node;
   This can speed up the resync progress by multiple orders of magnitude
 * Merged changes from the 9.1.8 release
  - restore protocol compatibility with drbd-8.4
  - detect peers that died silently when starting a two-phase-commit
  - correctly abort two-phase-commits when a connection breaks between
    phases 1 and 2
  - allow re-connect to a node that was forced into secondary role and
    where an opener is still present from the last time it was primary
  - fix a race condition that allowed to configure two peers with the
    same node id
  - ensure that an open() call fails within the auto-promote timeout
    if it can not succeed
  - build fixes for RHEL9
  - following upstream changes to DRBD up to Linux 5.17 and updated compat

9.2.0-rc.4 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * Merged fixes from the 9.1.6 release
  - fix IO to internal meta-data for backing device larger than 128TB
  - fix resending requests towards diskless peers, this is relevant when
    fencing is enabled, but the connection is re-established before fencing
    succeeds; when the bug triggered it lead to "stuck" requests
  - remove lockless buffer pages handling; it still contained very hard to
    trigger bugs
  - make sure DRBD's resync does not cause unnecessary allocation in
    a thinly provisioned backing device on a resync target node
  - avoid unnecessary resync (or split-brain) due to a wrongly generated
    new current UUID when an already IO frozen DBRD gets new writes
  - small fix to autopromote, when an application tries a read-only open
    before it does a read-write open immediately after the peer primary
    vanished ungracefully
  - split out the secure boot key into a package on its own, that is
    necessary to allow installation of multiple drbd kernel module packages
  - Support for building containers for flacar linux

9.2.0-rc.3 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a corner case that might cause conflicting requests (touching
   a storage area that is under resync) to not terminate
 * merge from drbd-9.0: fix failing read-only open immediately after
   a primary peer left the cluster ungracefully

9.2.0-rc.2 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * Fix broken wire compatibility with drbd-9.x
 * Fix DKMS builds when the kernel config has CONFIG_INFINIBAND=n

9.2.0-rc.1 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * was forked off between 9.1.4 and 9.1.5
 * implemented a geniue way of coordinating resync and application IO;
   removed the internal resync_lru
 * receive and process ack-packets in TCP/RDMA SOFTIRQ context, that
   improves latency on all write operations; removed ack_receiver thread
 * add RDMA transport for IB, RoCE networking
