9.2.0-rc.4 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * Merged fixes from the 9.1.6 release
  - fix IO to internal meta-data for backing device larger than 128TB
  - fix resending requests towards diskless peers, this is relevant when
    fencing is enabled, but the connection is re-established before fencing
    succeeds; when the bug triggered it lead to "stuck" requests
  - remove lockless buffer pages handling; it still contained very hard to
    trigger bugs
  - make sure DRBD's resync does not cause unnecessary allocation in
    a thinly provisioned backing device on a resync target node
  - avoid unnecessary resync (or split-brain) due to a wrongly generated
    new current UUID when an already IO frozen DBRD gets new writes
  - small fix to autopromote, when an application tries a read-only open
    before it does a read-write open immediately after the peer primary
    vanished ungracefully
  - split out the secure boot key into a package on its own, that is
    necessary to allow installation of multiple drbd kernel module packages
  - Support for building containers for flacar linux

9.2.0-rc.3 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * fix a corner case that might cause conflicting requests (touching
   a storage area that is under resync) to not terminate
 * merge from drbd-9.0: fix failing read-only open immediately after
   a primary peer left the cluster ungracefully

9.2.0-rc.2 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * Fix broken wire compatibility with drbd-9.x
 * Fix DKMS builds when the kernel config has CONFIG_INFINIBAND=n

9.2.0-rc.1 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:18)
--------
 * was forked off between 9.1.4 and 9.1.5
 * implemented a geniue way of coordinating resync and application IO;
   removed the internal resync_lru
 * receive and process ack-packets in TCP/RDMA SOFTIRQ context, that
   improves latency on all write operations; removed ack_receiver thread
 * add RDMA transport for IB, RoCE networking
