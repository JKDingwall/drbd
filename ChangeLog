9.1.5-rc.1 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:17)
--------
 * merged all changes from drbd-9.0.32
 * fixed a locking regression of the 9.1 branch, only relevant in
   the moment a local backing device delivers an IO error to drbd
 * removed compat support for kernel older than Linux-3.10 (RHEL7)
 * code cleanups and refactoring

9.1.4 (api:genl2/proto:110-121/transport:17)
--------
 * merged all changes from drbd-9.0.31
 * enabled dynamic debug on some additional log messages
 * remove (broken) write conflict resolution, replace it with warning
   about the fact
 * debugfs entry for the interval tree

9.1.3 (api:genl2/proto:110-120/transport:17)
--------
 * merged all fixes from drbd-9.0.30-0rc1
 * fix a corner-case NULL deref in the lockless buffer pages handling; the
   regression was introduced with 9.1.0 (released Feb 2021); To my knowledge
   it took 6 months until someone triggered it for the first time
 * fix sending a P_PEERS_IN_SYNC packet into a fresh connection (before
   handshake packets); this problem was introduced when the drbd-8.x
   compatibility code was removed
 * remove sending a DRBD-barrier packet when processing a REQ_PREFLUSH
   request, that improves IO-depth and improves performance with that

9.1.2 (api:genl2/proto:110-120/transport:17)
--------
 * merged all fixes from drbd-9.0.29; other than that no changes in this branch

9.1.1 (api:genl2/proto:110-119/transport:17)
--------
 * fix a temporal deadlock you could trigger when you exercise promotion races
   and mix some read-only openers into the test case
 * fix for bitmap-copy operation in a very specific and unlikely case where
   two nodes do a bitmap-based resync due to disk-states
 * fix size negotiation when combining nodes of different CPU architectures
   that have different page sizes
 * fix a very rare race where DRBD reported wrong magic in a header
   packet right after reconnecting
 * fix a case where DRBD ends up reporting unrelated data; it affected
   thinly allocated resources with a diskless node in a recreate from day0
   event
 * changes to socket buffer sizes get applied to established connections immediately;
   before it was applied after a re-connect
 * add exists events for path objects
 * fix a merge-mistake that broke compatibility with 5.10 kernels

9.1.0 (api:genl2/proto:110-119/transport:16)
--------
 * was forked off from drbd 9.0.19
 * has all changes up to 9.0.28-1
 * locking in the IO-submit code path was considerably improved,
   allowing multiple CPU to submit in parallel
