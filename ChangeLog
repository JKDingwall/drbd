9.1.0-rc.2 (api:genl2/proto:110-119/transport:16)
--------
 * merged fixes from 9.0.28-rc2
  - fix a regression introduces with 9.0.25; it failed to determine the
    right device size and the connection hangs in WFBitmapS/WFBitmapT
    repl state; to trigger this you need to do a partial resync to a
    new node with different backing device size
  - fix a race condition that causes a detach operation to hang; it
    is very hard to trigger

9.1.0-rc.1 (api:genl2/proto:110-119/transport:16)

 * has all changes up to 9.0.28-rc1

   allowing multiple CPU to submitt in parallel
